1. Why did Fibonacci fail the testThrowsIllegalArgumentException< test? What (if anything) did
you have to do to fix it? If you did not have to change anything to fix this issue, explain why.

The condition of the first if statement was set to n <= 0 and to determine whether the input
number is negative. In this case, 0 is involved to trigger the error, however, 0 is not a negative
number so should not throw the error. Therefore, the if condition should be revised into n < 0.


2. Why did Fibonacci fail the testBaseCase test? What (if anything) did you have to do to fix
it? If you did not have to change anything to fix this issue, explain why.

Due to the same reason, if the first if condition is set to n <= 0, then 0 would trigger the
error instead of returning the correct value: 1. To fix the issue, the condition of the first
if statement should be n < 0.

3.Why did Fibonacci fail the testInductiveCase test? What (if anything) did you have to do to
fix it? If you did not have to change anything to fix this issue, explain why.

There are two places need to be changed. First, the condition of the second else if statement was
n <= 2, therefore the returned value of n = 2 is 1, which is supposed to be 2. Second, the return
statement inside else was the minus of two values, which is supposed to be the sum of the two values
according to the definition of Fibonacci, therefore, it fails against rest of the tests. To fix the
issue, the condition of else if statement should be n <= 1, and "-" should be revised to be "+" for
the return statement.
