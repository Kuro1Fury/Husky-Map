# Test that the path is the shortest based on node name

created graph A

added node n1 to A
added node n2 to A
added node n3 to A
added node n4 to A
added edge Edge from n1 to n2 in A
added edge Edge from n2 to n4 in A
added edge Edge from n3 to n4 in A
added edge Edge from n1 to n3 in A

path from n1 to n4:
n1 to n2 via Edge
n2 to n4 via Edge
