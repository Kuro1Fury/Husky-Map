Briefly list any changes you made to your graph class during hw-marvel, and why you made those changes.

First, based on the feedback on GradeScope, I delete compareTo method implemented from Comparable, I
change the listChildren method to avoid representation exposure, and adjust the if statement in checkRep
to enable check that cost nothing even if the debug flag is off. And I also comment deleteNode and
deleteEdge since they are useless currently.
Moreover, I change my overall data structure. Originally, I have nested classes involving edge and node
inside graph class, now I delete node class and make a single string representing a node to reduce the
runtime and increase the efficiency.
