# sampleGrpah test
# Tests that a graph can be created which is identical with the graph of
# Figure 1 in the spec. There are four nodes: a, b, c, and d, and there
# are four edges: a to a, a to b, b to a, and b to c.

# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add four nodes
added node a to graph1
added node b to graph1
added node c to graph1
added node d to graph1

# Add four edge
added edge e1 from a to a in graph1
added edge e2 from a to b in graph1
added edge e3 from b to a in graph1
added edge e4 from b to c in graph1

# Print the nodes in the graph and the outgoing edges from a, b, c, and d
graph1 contains: a b c d
the children of a in graph1 are: a(e1) b(e2)
the children of b in graph1 are: a(e3) c(e4)
the children of c in graph1 are:
the children of d in graph1 are:
