# selfEdge test
# Tests that a normal graph can be created, with a node n1. There is
# one edges, n1 to n1, to test whether self point edge is allowed.

# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add one node
added node n1 to graph1

# Add one edges
added edge e1 from n1 to n1 in graph1

# Print the nodes in the graph and the outgoing edges from n1 and n2
graph1 contains: n1
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n1(e1)
