# selfEdge test
# Tests that a normal graph can be created, with a node n1. There is
# one edges, n1 to n1, to test whether self point edge is allowed.

# Create a graph
CreateGraph graph1

# Add one node
AddNode graph1 n1

# Add one edges
AddEdge graph1 n1 n1 e1

# Print the nodes in the graph and the outgoing edges from n1 and n2
