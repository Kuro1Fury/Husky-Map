# bidirectionEdge test
# Tests that a normal graph can be created, with two non-null nodes,
# Node a, Node b, and Node c. There are two edges, (1) n1 to n2, (2)
# n2 to n1, to test whether bi-direction edge is allowed.

# Create a graph

# Add two nodes

# Print the nodes in the graph and the outgoing edges from n1 and n2
